# postman-security-test-generator
For role based applications, security tests can be a burden to create and maintain. Each endpoint must be tested for every role in the system to ensure you are not allowing unsecured access. The postman security test generator will look at your OpenAPI spec, generate, and execute an exhaustive test to validate your endpoints are locked down like they should be.
